We are making every effort to ensure that no one knows what your responses were on the survey.  Google 
is a well known company that collects data for online survey research.  The researchers are using an 
encrypted version of their product to reduce the risk to subjects that their responses will be viewed by 
unauthorized persons.  However, the study is not being run from a secure http server such as those used to 
handle credit card transactions, so there is a small possibility that responses could be viewed by 
unauthorized third parties, such as computer hackers.
